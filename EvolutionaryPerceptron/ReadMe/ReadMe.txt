EvolutionaryPerceptron:

Version: 1.0.0.0

EvolutionaryPerceptron is my first project in conventional neuroevolution
and is meant to get my feel wet w/the concept. EvolutionaryPerceptron 
combines a perceptron with a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm is 
used to evolve the weights and bias of the perceptron, so that it can
preform a task. In this case, the perceptron is evolved to distinguish
between two cloud types: Cumulus and Cirrus clouds based on their
altitude and shape (see CloudsDataSet.txt for more info).
